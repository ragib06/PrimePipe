Fancy prime generation:
-----------------------
There are threads representing the "filters" of sieve and interthread communication is managed with Java Pipes
It can be used to visualize the sieve method of prime generation with proper GUI

Usage:
- "java Generator [MAX_NUMBER]"
- For example, run "java Generator 1000" for the primes below 1000
