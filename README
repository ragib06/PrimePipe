Fancy prime generation !
-----------------------------------
It was an outsourcing task :P
It was can be used to visualize the sieve method of prime generation with proper GUI.
There are threads representing the "filters" of sieve and interthread communication is managed with java Pipes :)

Usage:
- Generator class holds the "main" method
- put the limit (upto which primes you need) in the first argument
i.e. "java Generator 1000" prints the primes under 1000
